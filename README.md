# ‚òï Java Data Structures & Algorithms

A personal repository dedicated to my journey of learning and implementing various Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. This collection serves as my practice ground and a way to track my progress.

## üéØ About This Repository

This repository is a chronicle of my progress in mastering DSA. It contains my personal implementations of common data structures and algorithms, created for learning, practice, and skill reinforcement. The goal is to build a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals, one commit at a time.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

The code is organized into folders based on the specific data structure or algorithm category.

---

## üöÄ How to Use

To run any of the programs, you'll need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your_username/JAVA_DSA.git](https://github.com/your_username/JAVA_DSA.git)
    ```

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd JAVA_DSA
    ```

3.  **Compile a Java file:**
    For example, to compile `BinarySearch.java`:
    ```bash
    javac Arrays/BinarySearch.java
    ```

4.  **Run the compiled code:**
    *(Note: This assumes your Java files have a `package` declaration, like `package Arrays;`)*
    ```bash
    java Arrays.BinarySearch
    ```
